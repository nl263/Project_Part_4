        <img src="images/NJIT.jpg" alt = "Image of NJIT">
        <p>My name is Neil Lakshmanan and I'm an avid fan and small-time competitor of platform fighting games.</p>
        <p>Initially, I started off playing Super Smash Bros. Melee casually. However, like many others in the community, I soon discovered the competitive scene for the game and fell in love with the technicalities/flashiness of the game's engine</p>
        <p>During the summer of 2020, one of my closets friend, who is also an avid fan of platform fighters as well, introduced me to Dan Forance's: "Rivals of Aether." </p>
        <p>While I was skeptical at first, after hours of playing I soon came to realize that Rivals of Aether is a true love letter to the advanced platform fighters that I used to play and adore. Since the summer, I have competed in multiple Rivals of Aether tournaments, and have even managed to place 2nd in the NA Amateur Series.</p>
        <p>With the knowledge I have developed over the months playing this wonderful game, I want to advocate for more players to give this brilliant game a try and now's better than ever. </p>
        <p>Outside of Rivals, I am currently a junior and will be entering my fourth year at the New Jersey Institute of Technology pursuing an Information Technology Major. </p>
